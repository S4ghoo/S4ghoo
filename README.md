I'm a passionate software engineering student with a growing interest in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning.I'm currently a beginner  learning new concepts and exploring different tools and technologies. I'm working on various small projects to build my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and AI applications. I'm excited to grow through hands-on experience, contribute to open-source communities, and keep learning from real-world challenges.
